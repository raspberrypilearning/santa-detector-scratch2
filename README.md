No more propping your eyes open with matchsticks to try and catch Santa! This Scratch program uses a low-cost, infra-red detector to set off an alarm when Santa sneaks into your room. It's a great introduction to using simple sensors on the Raspberry Pi, and can be adapted to lots of different projects.
